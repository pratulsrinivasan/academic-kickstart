I am a PhD student in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley, advised by [Professor Ren Ng](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html) and [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/). My research interests include problems in computer vision, computer graphics, computational photography, and machine learning. I am fortunate to be supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

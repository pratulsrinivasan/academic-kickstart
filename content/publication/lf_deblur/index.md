# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We study the problem of deblurring light fields of general 3D scenes captured under 3D camera motion and present both theoretical and practical contributions. By analyzing the motion-blurred light field in the primal and Fourier domains, we develop intuition into the effects of camera motion on the light field, show the advantages of capturing a 4D light field instead of a conventional 2D image for motion deblurring, and derive simple methods of motion deblurring in certain cases. We then present an algorithm to blindly deblur light fields of general scenes without any estimation of scene geometry, and demonstrate that we can recover both the sharp light field and the 3D camera motion path of real and synthetically-blurred light fields."
